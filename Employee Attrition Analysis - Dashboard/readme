Hello, Folks

I am delighted to share my Power BI Dashboard called Employee Attrition Analysis. This interactive dashboard uncovers various insights about the employee attrition rate in an organization. 
The report helps identify key reasons for employee attrition and suggests necessary measures to reduce the turnover rate. 
Below, I am addressing the key insights in a precise manner. Additionally, I have provided the dataset in this folder for reference.

Key Insights:

1. Attrition Rate: Out of 1,470 employees, 237 have left the company, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.12%.
2. Gender Disparity: The attrition rate of male employees is higher than that of female employees.
3. Job Satisfaction: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the lowest job satisfaction scores, contributing to their higher attrition rates.
4. Age Group: Employees aged 26-35 have the highest attrition rate. Those who have been with the company for 0-2 years are leaving the most.
5. Salary Impact: Employees with salaries below $10k have the highest attrition rate.
6. Educational Background: Employees with a background in Life Sciences or Medical fields have a higher attrition rate.

Additional Information:

I have created new measures and calculated columns using DAX based on the objectives to uncover hidden information from the data. I also performed data cleaning and pre-processing using the Power Query Editor. 
To ensure effective storytelling, I used simple and impactful visuals. Filters and slicers are included to allow users to focus on specific areas of interest.
